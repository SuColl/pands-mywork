# grade_extra3.py
# This program reads in a studentâ€™s percentage mark and prints out corresponding the grade. The program checks that the percentage is valid. This program rounds grades - ie 69.5 gets rounded to 70 so is equal to a Distinction.

grade = float(input("Enter grade percentage (0-100): "))


# Method 1 - change the selection limits to account for the rounding
if grade > 100 or grade < 0:

# Method 2 - round the grade to the nearest integer, then compare it to the original grade bands.
