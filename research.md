## week 06 - Functions
unpacking tuples? see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unpacking-a-tuple-in-python/

tuples can be defined without parentheses: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-are-parentheses-required-around-a-tuple-in-python/
"When creating a tuple through assignment, you can omit the parentheses. Python implicitly understands that a comma-separated sequence of values is a tuple."

keyword arguments: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments (this link has lovely examples of passing positional and keywork arguments.) "In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments."
